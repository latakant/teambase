Connect to the Cortex Orchestrator and load current state.
Run this at the start of every session to know what's pending.

---

## Step 0 — Token Budget (before anything else)

Apply these 6 rules for the entire session. They reduce wasted tokens and keep context lean.

```
PRINCIPLE 1 — REFERENCE OVER COPY
  Never paste content that exists in a reachable file.
  CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md are navigation indexes — not documentation.
  Say: "Full schema: prisma/schema.prisma" — not the schema itself.

PRINCIPLE 2 — LOAD ON DEMAND
  Load a file only when the current task explicitly touches it.
  "I might need this" is not a reason to load.

PRINCIPLE 3 — READ HEADERS BEFORE FULL FILES
  Memory files have LOAD WHEN: headers.
  Check the header. If the task doesn't match → skip the file.

PRINCIPLE 4 — WRITE FORWARD, NEVER RE-READ
  When building or installing CORTEX files: write → verify (head -3) → move on.
  Never read a file you just wrote to reference it in the next file.

PRINCIPLE 5 — PARTIAL READS FOR LARGE FILES
  Files > 100 lines: read relevant section first, expand only if needed.
  TRACKER.md: last 5 entries. STATUS.md: score + blockers only.

PRINCIPLE 6 — SESSION BUDGET AWARENESS
  Tier 0 (free — already in context): CLAUDE.md · MEMORY.md · gitStatus
  Tier 1 (cheap — load once per session): STATUS.md · INVARIANT_MEMORY Quick Ref
  Tier 2 (task-triggered): domain skills · TRANSACTION_MEMORY
  Tier 3 (ARCH path only): ARCHITECTURE_MEMORY · DEPENDENCY_MEMORY · full diagrams
```

Full protocol: `core/MASTER-v11.3.md` (TOKEN_BUDGET merged into MASTER)

## Step 1 — Verify project isolation (Law 8)

Before doing anything else, confirm this project obeys Law 8.

```bash
# 1. ai/ and .claude/ must be gitignored
grep -q "^ai/" .gitignore && grep -q "^\.claude/" .gitignore \
  && echo "✅ Isolation: PASS" || echo "⚠️  Isolation: FAIL — add ai/ and .claude/ to .gitignore"

# 2. No cross-project path references in tracked files (quick scan)
git ls-files | xargs grep -l "\.\./[a-z]" 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If isolation fails:
```
⚠️  LAW 8 VIOLATION — Project Isolation
    This project is missing ai/ or .claude/ in .gitignore.
    CORTEX governance files will leak to remote if committed.
    Fix: echo "ai/" >> .gitignore && echo ".claude/" >> .gitignore
    Ref: C:\luv\Cortex\core\SYSTEM_LAWS.md — Law 8
```

Proceed regardless — isolation check is a warning, not a session blocker.

---

## Step 2 — Check if orchestrator is running

```bash
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:7391/health
```

If it fails (not running):
```
⚫ Cortex Orchestrator offline.
   To start: cortex-server start --bg
   Continuing with local context only (MEMORY.md + STATUS.md).
```

Proceed with the session using local memory files.
Do NOT block on this — orchestrator is optional enhancement.

---

## Step 3 — Load status snapshot

```bash
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:7391/status
```

Parse response and render the SESSION BRIEF:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CORTEX SESSION BRIEF — [today's date]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Score:     [score]/100  [ALLOW ✅ | WARN ⚠️ | BLOCK 🚫]

Pending tasks ([count]):
  [priority-icon] [task.title]  ([task.phase])
  ...

Active blueprints:
  [bp.name] ([bp.appType]) — [bp.status]
  ...

Last session:
  [session.summary or "(no summary)"]
  [date]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Priority icons: 🔴 1-2 (critical) · 🟡 3-5 (normal) · 🟢 6-9 (low)

---

## Step 4 — Start a session record

```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7391/sessions/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "claude"}'
```

Save the returned session `id` — you'll need it for `/cortex-sync`.

```
SESSION ID: sess_[xxx]  (keep this for /cortex-sync at end)
```

---

## Step 5 — Route the user's task

After displaying the brief, ask:

```
What are you working on today?
```

Route based on answer:

| Answer mentions | Route to |
|----------------|---------|
| new project / idea | `/cortex-blueprint` |
| bug / broken / fix | `/cert-fix` |
| new feature / add | `/cert-plan` → `/cert-build` |
| review / check | `/cert-review` |
| deploy / launch | `/cert-deploy` |
| score / audit | `/cert-verify` |
| just a question | Answer directly |

---

## If score is BLOCK (< 95):

```
⛔ SCORE BELOW THRESHOLD — [score]/100
   No new features until score recovers.

   Blockers:
   [list blockers from status]

   Run /cert-verify to see full detail.
   Fix blockers first, then continue.
```

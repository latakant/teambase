Execute the FIX: protocol — resolving a known issue from the TRACKER or open-issues list.

$ARGUMENTS

FIX: is different from BUG: — the issue is already identified, documented, and has a fix plan.
No diagnosis needed. Go straight to the fix with full context from the tracker.

---

**STEP 1 — Load the issue**
Parse the issue ID from $ARGUMENTS (e.g., ERR-02, TYPE-01, DB-03, QUAL-01).

Read: `ai/state/open-issues.json` — find the issue entry (severity, file, fix instructions)
Read: `ai/STATUS.md` — confirm this issue is still open (not already fixed)
Read: `ai/governance/ENGINEERING_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md` — find the exact code steps if documented

If issue not found in open-issues.json: it may already be fixed. Check `ai/fixes/applied/FIX_LOG.md`.
If already fixed: report the fix date and what was done. Do not re-apply.

---

**STEP 2 — Classify the fix**
From the issue details:
- TRIVIAL (1-3 lines, no schema) → proceed directly
- FEATURE (new logic, new file) → present plan, wait for "OK"
- ARCH (schema change, new module) → present plan, wait for "approved"

---

**STEP 3 — Ground + Read target**

**Run /cert-ground "<issue description>"** before touching any file.

- 🔴 BLOCKED → stop (e.g. file missing, TypeScript baseline broken) — resolve first
- ⚠ REVIEW NEEDED → issue may already be partially fixed or affect different files — check
- ✅ GROUNDED → Ground Truth block is your verified snapshot for the fix session

If cert-ground finds the issue is already fixed → verify with the fix test, close the issue, stop.
Otherwise: use the verified file/symbol snapshot from cert-ground as the base. Do not re-read
files that cert-ground already read — trust the snapshot.

---

**STEP 4 — Apply the fix**
Follow the exact fix instructions from `ENGINEERING_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md` if available.
Otherwise:
- No `any` — use `unknown` + type guards
- Minimal change — only what fixes the issue
- No refactoring of surrounding code
- Apply the enterprise 8-question check to confirm the fix doesn't introduce a new issue

---

**STEP 5 — Verify**
- Run: `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors required
- Run: `npx jest --testPathPattern=<module> --passWithNoTests` — tests pass

---

**STEP 6 — Close the issue**

Update `ai/state/open-issues.json` — mark the issue as resolved (remove it or set status=fixed).
Update `ai/STATUS.md` — remove the issue from the open items list.
Append to `ai/fixes/applied/FIX_LOG.md`:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD] [ISSUE-ID] [module] — [what was fixed] — files: [file:line]
```
Run enterprise checker to confirm score improved:
`node scripts/enterprise-checker.js --check`
Update `ai/state/current-score.json` if score changed.

---

**STEP 7 — Update TRACKER**
Append to `ai/TRACKER.md`:
```
[YYYY-MM-DD] FIX [ISSUE-ID] — [module] — [issue description] — CLOSED
```

---

**STEP 8 — Log lifecycle event**
Run: `node scripts/lifecycle.js log --action=BUG_FIXED --module=<module> --detail="[ISSUE-ID] closed: <what was fixed>"`

---

**LAYER LOG — append to `ai/lifecycle/LAYER_LOG.md`:**

```
